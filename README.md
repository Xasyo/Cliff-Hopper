3D game made with Unity based on the real game Cliff Hopper. Joc fet per l'assignatura de Videojocs del GEI a la FIB. Mark: 10.

If you want to play the game all you need to do is download the Binary folder and run the aplication file inside.

We created a main menú where the game level can be seen in the background. Four buttons are found in this screen, play, instructions, credits and quit.

In the instructions screen there is a brief explanation of the game.

The credits screen shows the name of the people who have worked on the project. In this case it's Iván Risueño and myself, Xavier Leonardo.

As soon as the play button button is pressed, the gameplay begins. The original game is a 3D endless runner. However, in our case the level is fixed and lasts about a minute. It has different objects and obstacles:
- Giant rock: Follows the player during the level, representing the main threat although it cannout reack it.
- Lava: Burns the player and has a particle system that emulates the fire of lava.
- Saw: Can cut the palyer and it moves back and forth having a particle system that emulates sparks.
- Spikes: Can stab the player if it lands on them.
- Moving blocks: May cause the player to fall since it has to calculate more precisely when to jump.
- Coin: The player can collect them in order to face another challenge when completing the level.

We have created different menus that pop up when different events happen while the game is running (i.e. pause, game over or you won). All of them show the current score of the player and the number of coins collected. From this menus the player can either quit the game, resume it or restart the level.
