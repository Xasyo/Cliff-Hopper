# Cliff-Hopper
3D game made with Unity based on the real game Cliff Hopper. Joc fet per l'assignatura de Videojocs del GEI a la FIB.

If you want to play the game all you need to do is download the Binary folder and run the aplication file inside.

We created a main menú where the game level can be seen in the background. Four buttons are found in this screen, play, instructions, credits and quit.

In the instructions screen there is a brief explanation of the game.

The credits screen shows the name of the people who have worked on the project. In this case it's Iván Risueño and myself, Xavier Leonardo.

As soon as the play button button is pressed, the gameplay begins. The game is a 3D endless runner with different obstacles and items. However, in our case the level is fixed and lasts about a minute.

We have created different menus that pop up when different events happen while the game is running (i.e. pause, game over or you won). All of them show the current score of the player and the number of coins collected. From this menus the player can either quit the game, resume it or restart the level.
